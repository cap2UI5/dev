# AGENTS.md — cap2UI5 (the deployable CAP app)

Guidance for AI agents and contributors. Read before making any change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This repository is a generated build artifact.** It is published 1:1 by
> [builder-cap2UI5](https://github.com/cap2UI5/builder-cap2UI5) — every
> publish wipes and rewrites everything except `.git/` and `.github/`.
> **Do not hand-edit anything outside `.github/` here** (including this
> file, the README and the devcontainer — they ship from
> builder-cap2UI5:`src/`).

## Where changes belong

| You want to change… | Edit in |
|---|---|
| the app skeleton (`srv/server.js`, `z2ui5-service.*`, `db/`, `mta.yaml`, `test/`, README, devcontainer, this file) | [builder-cap2UI5](https://github.com/cap2UI5/builder-cap2UI5) → `src/` |
| the framework / core package (`core/` — engine, `core/srv/z2ui5/`, bundled samples, webapp) | [builder-abap2UI5-js](https://github.com/cap2UI5/builder-abap2UI5-js) → `src/` (or its transpiler pipelines) |
| this repo's CI (`.github/workflows/` — `test.yml`, `trigger_web.yml`, `deploy-check.yml` — and `.github/dependabot.yml`) | here — `.github/` is the only repo-owned folder |
| your own apps (as a **user** of cap2UI5) | **your own CAP project** — install the package, `using from 'abap2UI5/z2ui5-model'` + `'abap2UI5/z2ui5-service'`, and point at your folder with `Z2UI5_APP_DIRS` / `require("abap2UI5/register-apps")(dir)`. `srv/app/` here works for a quick look but is overwritten on every publish, so nothing you want to keep belongs in it. |

## Layout

- App at the repo root: `app/` (webapp + starter page), `db/` (draft table
  `cap2ui5.z2ui5_t_01`), `srv/` (service, server wiring, `srv/app/` custom
  apps, `srv/external/` Northwind model), `test/` (jest), `scripts/`
  (`vendor-core.js`, the production-build step), `mta.yaml` (BTP deployment).
- `core/` — the **vendored** platform-neutral core package (npm name
  `abap2UI5`, linked via `"abap2UI5": "file:./core"`): engine, framework
  classes (`core/srv/z2ui5/`), ~105 bundled samples
  (`core/srv/app/samples/`), the z2ui5 webapp source. Its dependency tree is
  part of the app lock (under `core/node_modules/`), so **one** `npm ci` at
  the root installs everything.

## Building for deployment

`npm run build:production` — **not** a bare `cds build --production`. The
CDS build stages the server module into `gen/srv` and copies the app's
`"abap2UI5": "file:./core"` dependency with it, but never the target of that
specifier; `scripts/vendor-core.js` puts the vendored core there afterwards.
Without it the pushed module resolved `abap2UI5` to a dangling symlink and
died at startup with `Cannot find module 'abap2UI5/engine'` — silently,
because `npm ci` does not check symlink targets and `cds build` exits 0.
`mta.yaml`'s `before-all` runs the pair, `test/production-build.test.js`
gates it, and `deploy-check.yml` installs and loads the staged module.

The same step drops `openui5-dist` from the staged tree. It is the UI5
runtime `cds watch` serves at `/resources` locally; on BTP `/resources` is
routed to the `ui5` destination, so the deployed server never serves it —
and shipping it cost 611 MB and 43 advisories (3 critical) of release
tooling. Staged tree today: 19 MB, 0 advisories.

## Run & test

```bash
npm install
npx cds watch          # http://localhost:4004/z2ui5/webapp/index.html
npm test               # jest: starter integration test + view builder test
```

## Pipeline context

builder-abap2UI5-js (nightly sync from upstream abap2UI5, rebuilds the core)
→ `trigger_cap` → builder-cap2UI5 `update_cap` (rebuild + jest gate +
publish **here** via deploy key `ACTION_KEY_APP`) → `trigger_web` here
(on every push to main, i.e. every publish; also manual) kicks
[builder-cap2UI5-web](https://github.com/cap2UI5/builder-cap2UI5-web), which
bundles this repo into the static site
[web-cap2UI5-build](https://github.com/cap2UI5/web-cap2UI5-build)
(GitHub Pages: https://cap2ui5.github.io/web-cap2UI5-build/).
